  of America; circulation of 273,000.
                             $425

Advertising Budget:          $950 for 2 ads in most widely read Lutheran magazines.


Total requested budget:     $2550


Note:  Requested advertising budget will be in addition to web-based, "grassroots"
  marketing through social networks and other cost-free methods. If the application
  would be granted by reducing or eliminating the advertising budget, that is not
  a deal-breaker for me. However, I am not likely to have $950 available for 
  advertising in the next few years without your assistance, which is why I have
  included it in the budget.
